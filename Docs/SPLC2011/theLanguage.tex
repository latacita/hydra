This section presents the language we propose for expressing constraints on feature models involving clonable features and we explain how we can validate these constraints by transforming them into a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).

% For instance, we can write a constraint such as illustrated below.
%
% \begin{equation}
% Room >= 3
% \end{equation}
%
% This constraint would specify a business rule that states that automated houses, in order to be cost-effective, must
% have at least three rooms. We add to the language the logical operators $and, or, not$ and $implies$, with the usual
% semantics. Using this simple language, we can express constraints on clonable features such as (1).
