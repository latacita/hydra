This paper has presented: (1) a language for specifying external constraints involving clonable features with a clearly defined semantics; and (2) how to analyse these constraints by transforming them into a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). Using both elements, software designers can express and analyse cross-tree constraints on feature models including clonable/multiple features. We have illustrate how both contributions works by applying them to a Smart Home SPL throughout the paper. 

As future work, we will implement more analysis operations in Hydra. We are also interested in analysing which kind of analysis operations can become undecidable due to the presence of clonable/multiple features. We will also explore how to integrate the Hydra constraint language in Ecore-based DSLs and how the our analysis technique can be used to analyse constraints defined over these DSLs.
