Clonable features, i.e. features whose cardinality has an upper bound greater than 1, were proposed several years ago. Although they have been included in several feature modelling tools, there is still no tool able to properly deal with constraints, such as dependencies or mutual exclusions, which include clonable features. The first challenge these tools find is that the semantics of these constraints becomes undefined in the presence of clonable features. As a consequence of this lack of semantics, the analysis and validation of these constraints is simply not feasible. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents: (1) a language for specifying external constraints involving clonable features with a clearly defined semantics; and (2) how to analyse these constraints by transforming them into a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). This language and the analyser have been incorporated into our feature modelling tool, called \emph{Hydra}. We validate our ideas by applying them to a SmartHome industrial software product line.
