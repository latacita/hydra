% The addition of clonable features to feature models have increased the
% expressiveness of feature models, allowing the modelling of structural
% variability. Using clonable features we can model that, for instance, automated
% houses have a variable number of floors and rooms. Nevertheless, clonable
% features create new research challenges. Currently, some  state-of-art feature modelling tools are able to model and configure clonable features. But, as the experienced reader probably knows, it is not always possible to express all the relationships between features using feature models. As a consequence, the the definition of external constraints, such as mutual exclusion between features, is often required. Nevertheless, the semantics of these state-of-art feature constraints become undefined when they are applied to clonable features. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper presents a new language for specifying external constraints between features, which supports clonable features. We also explain how to automatically determine if a given selection of features satisfies the constraints expressed in this new language by means of translating these constraints into a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). We validate our ideas by applying them to a SmartHome software product line provided by Siemens AG.

%Clonable features increase the expressiveness of traditional feature models, allowing the modelling of structural
%variability. Using clonable features, we can specify, for instance, automated
%houses have a variable number of floors and rooms.  it is not always possible to express all the relationships between features using feature models. For instance, in a feature model for a SmartHome, a feature like Presence Simulation might require the selection of an Automatic Lights features. As a consequence, the definition of external constraints, such as A implies B, to capture these relationships is often required. Nevertheless, the semantics of these state-of-art external constraints become undefined when they are applied to clonable features. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents: (1) a new language for specifying external constraints involving clonable features; and (2) an automatic reasoner, which transform these constraints into a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), in order to analyse them. We validate our ideas by applying them to a SmartHome industrial software product line.
